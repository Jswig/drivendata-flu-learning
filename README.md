# Driven Data: Flu Shot Learning

Repository for my work on the [Flu Shot Learning](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/) competition on Driven Data.
Driven Data profile: [apoirel](https://www.drivendata.org/users/apoirel/). Work in progress.

## ⚙ Setup 

Requirements
- `snakemake`
- `conda`

### For experimenting on local OS

This is only necessary if you intend to experiment with or modify
the code.
Create a conda environment with all the required packages: 
```sh
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## ♻ Reproducing the results 

### On local OS
In this directory
```sh
snakemake --use-conda all
```

### On Singularity (recommended)
```
snakemake --use-singularity --use-conda all
```
